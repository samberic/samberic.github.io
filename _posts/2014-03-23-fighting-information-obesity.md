<p>Hi. My name's Sam, I'm addicted to information and suffer from information obesity. I've always been a big fan of information, but I'd say I only started to gorge myself in the last year or so. &nbsp;My brain is overweight with the volume of information I'm putting in it. I don't even enjoy it anymore but I couldn't stop. &nbsp;However just recently I've been kicking the habit, and you can too!</p>
<p>Firstly, you need to know the symptoms of Information Obesity so you can self diagnose. Do you</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up in the morning, turn your alarm off, and read your email/facebook/twitter straight away?</li>
<li>Spend all of your public transport journeys immersed reading social networks/feedly feeds/the interwebz?</li>
<li>Open your email/social push notifications AS SOON AS YOU SEE THEM</li>
<li>Constantly check your phone so you can open your notifications AS SOON AS YOU SEE THEM</li>
<li>Feel like your brain is constantly slightly fuzzy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Chances are you're suffering from Information Obesity. &nbsp;I too was suffering this, but don't worry. You too can be cured.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5991495/why-my-iphone-is-better-as-a-dumbphone">this Gizmodo article</a> on turning your smartphone into a dumbphone; it was the inspiration for my experiment. &nbsp;I genuinely just found that at any given moment I already had my phone out checking for facebook updates or twitter posts or emails. God forbid I let an email go unread for several minutes! &nbsp;So I decided to try out a dumbphone diet, although not quite as extreme as Gizmodo.</p>
<ul>
<li>All push notifications were switched off, except for messaging apps (whatsapp etc)</li>
<li>All social type apps (fb, twitter, email) moved to the last screen on my iPhone</li>
<li>No checking any of those things on the phone; only on proper laptops</li>
</ul>
<p>I set off with the goal of managing a week, and I'm now punching over 2 weeks. &nbsp;And it's such a relief! I encourage you to give it a go. &nbsp;Things I have discovered</p>
<ul>
<li>On the first day I really, really struggled to not check my email. &nbsp;Addiction level difficult (ex smoker preaching here). &nbsp;This went through the roof when I saw I had over 20 or so emails on the little red notification on the mail app (by accident). &nbsp;I managed to make it till 5PM at which point I gave in. &nbsp;And my biggest discovery was that not a single one of those emails was of importance. &nbsp;I'd been lucky enough to have been retweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman">Scott Hanselman</a> after promoting his email list (which is epic, btw), hence the massive (for me)&nbsp;dump of emails. &nbsp;</li>
<li>And so with that, I realised that life goes on without me. &nbsp;No email needs answering desperately within 6 hours. It became easier. I moved email off to another screen to reduce the chance of accidentally looking at it, and it makes for fairly smooth sailing</li>
<li>I assigned time in the morning before work to sit and read/reply to emails. &nbsp;This was really cathartic, and meant I actually responded to emails as opposed to letting them hang around for a week and started the day clean. &nbsp;Pro Tip! I read somewhere on twitter about starting the day with a glass of cold water (supposedly better than coffee). &nbsp;Can highly recommend it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I'd also sit down after work to go through what's going on. &nbsp;Confining my email and socials to these period allowed my brain to breath</li>
<li>Commuting is really interesting without being locked into a smartphone. &nbsp;It allowed me to think. &nbsp;As cheesy as it sounds, I'd gotten to the point where I was so busy reading the entire internet, I didn't get chance to think about the day ahead, and to just let my brain go free for a bit. It's brilliant!</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to admit after the end of week 1 I've not been as stringent on these rules, but things are definitely better now. &nbsp;I miss a lot of twitter reading, but it's nothing I can't live without.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, if you think your brain is fat and overweight with the volume of information you're taking in, why not put it on a diet? &nbsp;Try it for a week!&nbsp;</p>
