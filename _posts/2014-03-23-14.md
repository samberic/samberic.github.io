So this weekend inspired by a project a couple of friends are doing I decided I fancied hacking around with the HTML5 paste API.  This quickly and rapidly turned into Corkboard, which you can see at <a href="http://pastey.samatkinson.com/">http://pastey.samatkinson.com</a>.  Here’s a corkboard of some of the photos  of me playing recently to satisfy my massive ego.

All in all I’d guess it’s probably taken somewhere between 6-8 hours, of which most was due to my inability to RTFM and the fact Javascript hates me.  Most of the project is just mashing up a bunch of pre existing ingredients.

<strong>STRd6 imgpaste plugin</strong>

When googling around for how to do it, most of the stackoverflow esque threads had been jumped on by STRd6 to point to the plugin he wrote, and  I salute him, because it works a treat. You can find it at <a href="http://strd6.com/2011/09/html5-javascript-pasting-image-data-in-chrome/" target="_blank">here</a>.  It binds to the paste command, checks it it’s an image, and if it is calls your callback with the file and the img encoded as a dataurl (particularly awesome/handy).  In no time I was pasting images to the top left of a blank page with a bit of jquery append() fun.

<strong>JQuery UI draggable and resizable</strong>

You can find these <a href="http://jqueryui.com/draggable/">here</a> and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/resizable/">here</a> respectively.  They should pretty much work out the box which is nice.  However, I wanted more than just images; If you mouse over an image you can remove it from corkboard. This was some CSS/JS magic lightly stolen from a friends project, but meant wrapping the image in a div.  I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to make the img resize at the same time as the div.  If you RTFM you’ll discover this wonder:
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-js">$pasteimage
                        .draggable()
                        .resizable({
                            alsoResize: $pasteimage.find('img'),
                            aspectRatio: true
                        }
                )</code></pre>
Pay special attention to alsoResize. This is the key to the gold.

To avoid manually generating the HTML at this point I created a simple template in <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a>.

<strong>Bootstrap</strong>

So now we can drag and resize images, but it’s fugly.  Along comes <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a>, the HTML5 UI starter package from the folks at Twitter. HIstorically I’ve always used <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">foundation</a> for making my sites pretty, but I wanted to branch out.  I’ve not done anything advanced, just a nav bar with drop down and a little form; The form inside nav bar situation is hard to do in foundation, so I was relieved to see it’s built in in bootstrap.  I had my usual pebcak issues of incorrect ordering/import of CSS and JS, but once up and running, it was very easy to use, and I think overall looks nicer than foundation.

<strong>Save as an image</strong>

So one of the nice features about corkboard is that you can save it to your local machine as an image. This was a mashup of 2 plugins; <a href="http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/">HTML2Canvas</a> and<a href="http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas2image/">Canvas2Image</a>. The first traverses the DOM of whatever element you pass it and renders it out as a Canvas; I imagine this may have issues if you’re doing anything very funky in your code but it worked out the box on this. Canvas2Image then gives you a whole bunch of images for turning a canvas into an image, and for downloading it.  Both plugins worked seemlessly, pretty much first time. Very impressive.
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-js">html2canvas($('#theFunStuff'), {
                onrendered: function (canvas) {
                   Canvas2Image.saveAsPNG(canvas);
                }
            })</code></pre>
And that’s basically the whole thing. There’s tons more I want to do (being able to raise/lower layers, rotating, persistance), but that’s for another day.  There’s also some issues on HTML2Canvas2Image depending on where the images are when the save happens I need to look into.
