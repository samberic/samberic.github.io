<p>I'm a huge fan of the kickstarter concept. As well as allowing technologies to exist that may not have without it, it allows me as a geek to get in on the ground floor.&nbsp; I've backed 2 things so far; My <a href="http://getpebble.com/">Pebble</a>, which is fantastic but was incredibly infuriating to wait for, taking well over a year, and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/750308586/stormfly-like-a-pc-on-your-wrist">Stormfly</a>, which I backed about 4 months ago in March.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stormfly's slogan is "Like a PC on your wrist".&nbsp; In effect, it's a wearable USB which you plug into a mac or windows PC and boot from, giving you access to a linux OS and all your files.&nbsp; There's a bunch of nice value adds such as a back up and 24h replace service.</p>

<p></p>
<p>There's a bunch of reasons you'd want something like this. Perhaps security, so you don't keep yourself logged onto friends machines. Maybe you're a big traveler and stay with friends.&nbsp; My personal reason was simple; When I travel with work I have to take my work laptop (locked down to the max and so useless for personal stuff) and my own laptop, for email, Facebook, videos, maybe a bit of development.&nbsp; My hope was I could boot Stormfly up on my work PC before all the encryption and lockdown shenanigans, meaning I could just take my work PC and still have a personal machine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Stormfly cost me $74 including shipping (yet another kickstarter shipping from China that charges more to send to HK than the US!), which was a fairly pricey bet that this would work.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I was really suprised to come home and find my stormfly had arrived having had no shipping notice, nor a kickstarter update to say they were shipping. That said, this was a nice surprise, and I'd rather it be this way as I'm far too impatient when waiting for shipping. The box is fairly small, basic cardboard so lacking a bit of shiney but sufficient for the job.</p>
<p>It comes with some basic instructions (namely, how to boot in mac/windows to stormfly) and has a QRcode for the website if you want more information.&nbsp; I dug straight in for the test.</p>
<p><br />My test machine for this was an X200 IBM Thinkpad. Plugged in Stormfly, held the thinkvantage button and prayed.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hey presto!&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; The installation process is fairly painless; as with everything these days there's a sizable download update.&nbsp; The OS is basically Ubuntu with a couple of extra apps thrown in related to Stormfly so it can back up for you to the cloud.&nbsp; I'm pleased by this as some of the earlier updates implied it might be quite heavily customized; and whilst it might be under the hood, in appearance it's just Ubuntu.&nbsp; All the updates are direct to the USB, so I can now take that and plug it into my Mac, my friends computers etc. and it will be my personal environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was lucky enough to get an email directly from Stormfly a few minutes later.&nbsp; I'm the first Kickstarter backer to register their Stormfly, so it's a big milestone for the company (and a little geek victory for me).&nbsp; No word on whether they'll throw in a t-shirt or some free subscription to congratulate me ;).</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've played with it for most the night, managed to get Java and IntelliJ up; I forgot how terrible Linux is for getting most stuff installed and working.&nbsp; It's really very nice and nippy.&nbsp; Will it be worth the cost?&nbsp; I think that will become clear over the next couple of weeks as I head out on holiday, followed by work travel, and I'll be leaving my regular laptop at home in favour of Stormfly.&nbsp; If you've got a corporate laptop and are fed up of carrying 2 around, I highly recommend you purchase one.</p>
