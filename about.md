Hi, I'm Sam. I'm a tech lead who's spent most of my career working at financial institutions.  I love Java and Kotlin, and I've picked up some reasonable JS and react skills along the way.

I don't like writing these things, so instead here's some answers to the question __"what could you talk about for 30 minutes with no prep?"__

* What developers can learn from astronauts (which I did as a talk at RedHat DevNation SF.  They messed the audio recording up, but you can catch bits of it [here](https://youtu.be/wYyrevshdSI))
* Why focusing on increasing your release cadence is the most important thing any team can do
* Why TDD is an incredibly important skill
* Lean Startup and my main failures and (less so) success with side hustles
* Hong Kong (and why you should definitely live abroad, at least for a little)
* US Politics
* Running and ultramarathons


If you want to chat more about anything, drop me an [email]("sam@samatkinson.com").
